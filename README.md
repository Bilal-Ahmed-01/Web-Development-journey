🚀 My Web Development Journey — From Zero to Building Real Projects

I started my web development journey with zero knowledge.
At the beginning, I did not know what HTML, CSS, or JavaScript was.
Even simple terms like tags, elements, and attributes were new to me.
I was confused, but I decided not to give up.

I began by learning the basics of HTML.
I learned how websites are structured.
I practiced making headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
Slowly, I started understanding how web pages are built.

After HTML, I moved to CSS.
CSS taught me how to design and style websites.
I learned colors, fonts, margins, padding, and layouts.
My first designed page was very simple, but I was proud of it.

Then I started learning JavaScript.
At first, JavaScript was very challenging for me.
But with practice, I understood logic and basic programming concepts.
I learned how to make websites interactive and dynamic.

I faced many errors and bugs during this journey.
Sometimes my code did not work at all.
But I learned that errors are part of learning.
Debugging made me a better problem solver.

I also learned how to use Git and GitHub.
I understood how to push code and manage repositories.
GitHub helped me track my progress and improve my work.

With time, I started building small projects.
Each project increased my confidence.
I learned by doing, not just watching tutorials.

This repository represents my growth from beginner to learner developer.
Every folder shows my effort, practice, and improvement.
This journey taught me patience, consistency, and discipline.

I am still learning and improving every day.
My goal is to become a professional web developer.
This is only the beginning of my journey 🚀
